koalabi is nor the original developer nor really a maintainer of VLDocking but a satisfied user of Lilian's work.  The sources have main been transferred to github so that they don't get lost.  Besides, he's using the library a lot less these days.  This should not prevent enthusiasts to submit pull requests.
